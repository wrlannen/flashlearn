## 🔌 API Endpoints

### `POST /api/generate-cards`

Generates flashcards for a given topic using OpenAI's GPT-4.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "topic": "JavaScript Promises",
  "context": ["Promise basics", "async/await"] // Optional: previously studied concepts
}
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "front": "What is a Promise in JavaScript?",
    "back": "A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the three states of a Promise?",
    "back": "Pending, Fulfilled, and Rejected."
  }
]
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to generate flashcards",
  "details": "Error message"
}
```

## 🎯 Usage Tips

1. **Be Specific with Topics**: Instead of "Math", try "Quadratic Equations" for better results
2. **Use Context Feature**: Generate new cards for the same topic to get different perspectives without repetition
3. **Review Regularly**: Use the card counter to track your progress
4. **Search Function**: Use the search bar to quickly find specific cards in large collections

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | - | Your OpenAI API key |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | ❌ No | `gpt-4o` | OpenAI model to use |
| `PORT` | ❌ No | `3000` | Server port |

### Tailwind CSS

The project uses Tailwind CSS 4.x. The configuration can be found in `tailwind.config.js`.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```
ERROR: Port 3000 is already in use!
```
**Solution**: Change the `PORT` in your `.env` file or kill the process using port 3000.

### OpenAI API Key Missing
```
OPENAI_API_KEY missing
```
**Solution**: Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### Cards Not Generating
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Check the browser console and server logs for error messages

## 📝 Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Frontend**: Edit `public/index.html` and `public/script.js`
2. **Backend**: Modify `server.js` for API changes
3. **Styling**: Update Tailwind classes in HTML or add custom CSS

### Debugging

The server includes comprehensive logging:
- All requests are logged with timestamps
- OpenAI API responses are logged
- Error details are logged to console

Check the terminal running `node server.js` for detailed logs.
